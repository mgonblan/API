    "title" : "Dogtor Partners API",
    "description" : "\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Dogtor Partners API is aimed at developers from POS systems that want to programmatically manage stores, keep their content updated and handle orders with the purpose of improving efficiency and keeping data in sync with their business.\n\n\n# Getting started\n\nIf this is the first time you operate with our API, please contact your Dogtor Account Manager (AM) to setup your credentials.\n\nYou'll be asked to provide the following information:\n- Details of the store(s) you want to operate with.\n- An unique identifier for each store.\n- A set of endpoint URLs for the notifications you want to receive from Dogtor (for example when an order is dispatched to your store).\n\n\n## API Credentials\n\nTo operate with this API you will be provided of a single static `token` that will work for all of the Stores under your control. This token is secret and should be kept in a secure place.\n\nFor more details on how to use it please review the [Authentication](#section/Authentication) section.\n\n## Unique identifier of the store\n\nSince you could be operating with multiple stores, identifying each one in every operation is be essential. It's important that you hold and share with us an unique identifier for every store integrated through this API.\n\nThis identifier will be requested for every endpoint call as a path parameter:\n\n```http\n/stores/YOUR-STORE-ID/...\n```\n\nWe will also make sure that you receive it as part all notifications we will be sending to your webhooks:\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"store_id\": \"YOUR-STORE-ID\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Marketplace orders\n\nThe delivery of an order can be either taken care by a Dogtor courier or by the store itself. For the cases Dogtor is not involved in the delivery process we identify these stores as **marketplace**.\nThrough this documention you will see notes and references destinated to these types of stores that require extra information to fulfill an order.\n\n## Event notifications using webhooks\n\nNotifications about different events that happen in Dogtor are going to be send to your systems using [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook).\n\nYour AM is going to request a set of endpoint URLs from your systems for us to send those notifications. Having a single endpoint for all notifications or different ones will be completely up to you and how your system is designed. \n\n```\n// example of some webhooks\nhttps://yourserver.com/Dogtor/orders/dispatched\nhttps://yourserver.com/Dogtor/orders/cancelled\n```\n\nIt is important that **all the webhook URLs are accessible from any IP address**. To understand more about security for these webhooks, please refer to the [Authentication](#section/Authentication) section.\n\nAs a general rule, we will be calling your registered webhooks with an HTTP `POST` method unless otherwise specified in the notification description.\n\nPlease refer to the [Order Notifications](#tag/Notifications) section to see all different events you can subscribe to along with the notification schemas.\n\n# Best Usage Policy\n\nPlease follow these guidelines in order to reduce potential issues that could delay rollout of your integration.\n\nWe strongly advise before using our system that the you check two important concepts:\n- The rate limit for the endpoint that you are intending to used is respected by the systems that will call it.\n- That the collection uploaded matches our [JSON schema](#json-schema), or it will be rejected as part of the upload process.\n- All image urls that are uploaded to the system should use the protocol HTTPS for security reasons - the JSON schema above will reject any that are not served by it.\n\nIf either of these cause issues or are not understood please contact your account manager for further information and support.\n\n# Store Image Guidelines\n\nIt is important to select appropriate images as the structure of store's collection affects the visual display of the products and directly impacts the user experience in both the Dogtor app and the website. \n    \n## Product Images\n\nProduct images are nice-to-have but not mandatory.\n\n  Specifications:\n\n    * Orientation: Square.\n    \n    * Dimensions: 1000 x 1000 px.\n    \n    * Format: JPG.\n    \n    * File size: below 1MB\n    \n    * Background: light, plain colour or plain texture (e.g. wooden)\n    \n    * Protocol: HTTPS\n\n    * You must show the product in a frontal plane\n    \n    * Each product separately\n  \nNote: It's important to maintain the coherent style of the product images (e.g. follow the same color palette and perspective) and keep in mind that for improving the user’s experience, it is recommended to have either all the products with an image or no pictures at all. Having only a few products with images across the collection creates visual chaos and can unwillingly contribute to boosting sales of only those products with visual representation.   \n\nIn the most common collection type (with Sections only) the products that contain images will be displayed as below:\n  \n<div align=\"center\" class=\"img-div\">\n  <img alt=\"product image 1\" src=\"img/product_image_1.png#center\" />\n</div>\n\nAfter selecting any product, the image becomes square: \n\n<div align=\"center\" class=\"img-div\">\n  <img alt=\"product image 2\" src=\"img/product_image_2.png#center\" />\n</div>\n\n## Collection Images\n\nCollection images generated automatically from 3 selected images of products grouped under the same collection. They will be displayed together as seen below:\n\n<div align=\"center\" class=\"img-div\">\n  <img alt=\"collection image\" src=\"img/collection_image.png#center\" />\n</div>\n\n\n## Supercollection Images\n\nThese are mandatory for all supercollections.\n\n  Specifications:\n\n    * Orientation: Horizontal.\n      \n    * Dimensions - 2484 x 1380 px.\n      \n    * Format: JPG.\n      \n    * File size: below 1,5 MB\n\n    * Protocol: HTTPS.\n      \n    * Must show the product in a close-up, without transparency\n      \n    * They can not be photomontages or contain logos or promotional elements pasted on the image\n      \n    * They can have the logo of the brand applied to commercial elements as napkins, tablecloths, etc.\n\nThey will appear in the app like this:\n\n<div align=\"center\" class=\"img-div\">\n  <img alt=\"collection image\" src=\"img/supercollection_image.png#center\" />\n</div>\n\n## Future changes\n\nPlease note that this part of the document is flux. There is the possibility of changes to some of the images specified here in the near future.\n\n# Authentication\n\nA static `token` to operate with our API will be provided by your AM. It's important that you keep it in a secure place. All API calls must be made over HTTPS. \n\nThe token won't be require to be changed over time, but if you think it was compromised in some way, please contact us so we can generate a new one.\n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n",

Here is a list of non-breaking changes Dogtor can introduce and your integration should support:\n  - Adding a new endpoint\n  - Adding a new optional field in a request body\n  - Setting a previously required field in a request to optional\n  - Changing error messages from responses\n  - Adding field in any notification to your webhooks\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Dogtor also can introduce **breaking changes** at any time. These changes will come with a previous notice and a provided amount of time will be granted to you to comply with them. Breaking changes might include:\n  - Deprecating an endpoint\n  - Adding a new required field in a request body\n  - Renaming a field in a request body\n  - Setting a previously optional field in a request to required\n",
